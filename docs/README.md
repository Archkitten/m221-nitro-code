# Plans
* Maven project that can run and deployed
* Create the landing page
* Create Nitro code
* Create login
* Add leaderboard
* To maintain site longterm, it will be deployed. And occasional updates by team members to ensure site is running fine.

# User-side plan
* User enters home page
* Choose what they want to do
* Get points if they did good in any feature we have in the website
* Have some type of features that explain data bases like sql data bases
* 
Reflection:
- Ask our sponsor, Mr. Mort, what he would like to see in the project. This includes a feature teaching students about an SQL data base.
